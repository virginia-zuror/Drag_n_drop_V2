# Technical Assessment // Drag and Drop

## Task

    • The canvas consists of three distinct areas: Header, Body, and Footer.
      Users can drag elements from the sidebar and drop them into these areas. The Body area accepts any type of element, while the Header area exclusively accepts            Image elements, and the Footer area exclusively accepts Text elements.
    • Elements within an area can be rearranged.
    • Elements can be reordered between the Header and Body areas but moving a Text element from the Body to the Footer or moving a Text from the Footer to the Body is        not permitted.
    • There is no limit to the number of elements that areas can hold.
